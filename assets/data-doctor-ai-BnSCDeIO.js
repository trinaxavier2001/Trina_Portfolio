Production-ready API and Python SDK for AI-powered CRM data deduplication and cleaning. Built to transform messy CRM data into clean, deduplicated records using advanced fuzzy matching, blocking algorithms, and optional AI embeddings.

Designed a comprehensive system combining multiple deduplication strategies—fuzzy matching for approximate string comparison, intelligent blocking to reduce computational complexity, and AI embeddings for semantic similarity detection. The architecture supports async processing for large datasets, implements authentication and rate limiting for production environments, and provides both RESTful API and Python SDK interfaces for flexible integration.

Key innovation: data quality scoring system that provides actionable health metrics across completeness, uniqueness, and consistency dimensions—enabling data teams to prioritize cleanup efforts systematically. Includes Docker deployment configuration and integrations for major CRM platforms (Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive), making enterprise adoption straightforward.
