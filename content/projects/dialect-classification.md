Applied transfer learning to acoustic dialect recognition, fine-tuning Wav2Vec2 on diverse English varieties including Danish-accented, Scottish, and other regional dialects. Achieved 82% → 90% accuracy improvement through systematic optimization of self-supervised pre-training objectives and careful data augmentation. Emphasized reproducibility by implementing comprehensive evaluation infrastructure with per-dialect F1 metrics, statistical confidence intervals, deterministic seeding, and versioned datasets—ensuring results could be validated across different research contexts and deployment scenarios.
