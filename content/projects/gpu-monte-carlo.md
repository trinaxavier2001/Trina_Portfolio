Designed and optimized a hybrid GPU-CPU 3D Monte Carlo simulation framework achieving 49Ã— performance improvement over single-core baselines. Beyond raw speed optimization, developed a comprehensive evaluation infrastructure with automated regression testing, real-time performance dashboards, and cost-per-step analytics. This systematic approach to performance measurement transformed computational gains into actionable insights for hyperparameter tuning and resource allocation decisions in production HPC environments.
