Architected a production-grade hospital database system balancing MongoDB's flexibility with strict data validation requirements. Implemented strategic indexing and schema design that reduced P95 query latency while maintaining data integrity through comprehensive validation rules. Developed deterministic import/export pipelines for CSV/JSON data with robust error handling, significantly reducing data ingestion errors and improving clinician workflow efficiency. The system's audit trail capabilities enhanced regulatory compliance and operational transparency in healthcare data management.
