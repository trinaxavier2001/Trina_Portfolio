Developed a robust ensemble architecture for medical image classification, improving macro-F1 from 0.71 to 0.77 on the HAM10000 benchmark through clinically-informed augmentation strategies that preserve diagnostic morphology. Tackled severe class imbalance by implementing Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) with Exponential Moving Average (EMA), deliberately trading 2% training efficiency for significantly improved rare-lesion detectionâ€”a critical consideration in medical AI where false negatives can have serious consequences. Built comprehensive evaluation infrastructure with per-class metrics, calibration analysis, and reproducible data versioning to support clinical validation workflows.
